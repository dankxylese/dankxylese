### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning DevOps thorough a personal project [CounterStrike Server (GitLab)](
  https://gitlab.com/DarkXylese/counterstrike-server) I have ambitious plans, all the way up to creating a discord bot for my small CS community to spawn/configure our game server(s).
  - Check out [Beatakt](
  https://github.com/dankxylese/Beatakt), which was my final Uni project - a Guitar-hero like rhythm game, which uses FFT to generate levels automatically. I will revive and finish it at some point, I promise.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes via an intensive course on [Prometheus](https://prometheus.org.ua/prometheus-plus/devops_and_kubernetes/)
- ðŸ’» Most of my newer projects will be on [my Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/DarkXylese)
